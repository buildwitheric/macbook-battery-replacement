🔧 MacBook Pro Battery Replacement (iFixit Toolkit)

This project documents a hands-on hardware repair where I replaced the worn-out battery in my 13-inch MacBook Pro using the iFixit replacement kit and repair guides. I completed this project as part of strengthening my IT hardware troubleshooting and repair skills.

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Diagnosing hardware issues (battery wear, cycle count, capacity loss, and performance degradation)
- Safely disassembling a laptop using proper tools and ESD precautions
- Replacing internal components with attention to detail and hardware safety
- Managing delicate connectors, screws, cables, and adhesive removal
